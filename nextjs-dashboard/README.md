For this course, I will be building a simplified version of the financial dashboard that has:

- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> The dashboard will also have an accompanying databse, which I'll set up in a later chapter.
